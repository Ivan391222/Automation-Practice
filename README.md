SKILLO Automation Course

This repository contains the final project of a test automation course for beginners. The cases you will find below belong to an absolute beginner in the test automation universe with a very distant knowledge of programming languages. 
There are 5 automation test cases. Their names and what they include are as it follows:

•	testcase1openBrowser - browser opening and closure

•	testcase2loginFailed - user tries to log in with wrong credentials, manily due to my disagreement to share my password publicly #GDPR

•	testcase3registration - a standard registration including random digits generator to ensure all sign ups are successful

•	testcase4loginAndLogout - user logs in, goes to his profile page and then logs out

•	testcase5followUser - user logs in, finds a certain profile of another user, opens it and follows / unfollows it, then opens a post of that user and likes it. The case is succesfull only in half of the executions.

Disclaimer 1: Upcoming updates are possible

Disclaimer 2: The style of the test cases is really really simple, as for a person with a very limited participation in the second part of the course
